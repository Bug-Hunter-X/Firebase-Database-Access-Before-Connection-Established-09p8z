This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase when accessing the database before the connection is established. The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version using promises or async/await to ensure proper initialization and asynchronous handling.  This is a critical issue for avoiding unexpected behavior and crashes in your Firebase application.
